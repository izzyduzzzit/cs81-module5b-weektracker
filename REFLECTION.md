# Izarra Villareal CS 81 JavaScript Module 5 Assignment 5B: My Week in Data

# Were your predictions accurate?
Yes, they were accurate.

# What surprised you about your week?
Nothing really surprised me about my week because I was the one entering in the data. I was more surprised by the difficulty of this module. The code is a level more complex when using functions within functions and having to learn the reduce function is quite difficult I think.

# Which higher order function was most useful and why?
I find the map and filter functions the most useful because I have less issues understanding how to use them specifically. The reduce function on the other hand was quite difficult for me.
